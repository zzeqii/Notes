Our solution is the smart contact lens called Era, which is an abbreviation of the education resources accessing and it is also a new era of smart contact lenses.

Our ERA lenses is a wearable screen, which can interact with the reality by recognising the world features and overlaying images. Functionalities can be achieved by eye motions. Later we may have a trial on brain-implanted sensor for brain computer interaction. With ERA, you can access the university libraries even browse the social-media. We provide a well-established community platform for user to exchange their information and communicate with each others. We also provide toolkits for developer to develop their own api that can be used by our contact lenses. It may somehow improve our product and borden its usage. 

these are the technology that supporting our era lens. we are modifying the existed product which produced by Samsung, Integrating with micro camera, eye motion detect sensor and microprocessor. Web API is the most important technology for extension that supporting our products.  we are using the tear power to drive our lenses. 

with the efficient interaction of eye motion, you can choose which part to record in the lecture . you can access it as long as you have the internet just like your smartphone. the community provides you with lots of existing study materials and save your searching time. Digital materials and resources can also save your cost on the physical books and papers.
